<h3>Project uses <strong>commitlint</strong></h3>

It checks if your commit messages meet the [conventional commit format](https://conventionalcommits.org).<br>

Example:

```bash
# Won't let you push non-conventional commit message
git commit -m "new feature"

# We're good to go!
git commit -m "feat: new feature"
```

For more examples and further information, please visit [commitlint documentation page](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#what-is-commitlint).
